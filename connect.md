Here you can find a web-based VoIP client that allows you to connect to your VoIP server directly from your web browser. This client utilizes the latest version of the [SIP.js](https://github.com/onsip/SIP.js) Library.

If you encounter issues with audio, such as not hearing the other person or them not hearing you, you may need to configure a TURN server. A TURN server helps with traversing firewalls and NATs to ensure proper audio transmission.

A reliable and free TURN service you can use is provided by [Open Relay](https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/).

Alternatively, you can use dedicated software to [connect]({{ site.github.url }}/client.html) to your VoIP server. However, this method requires port forwarding and involves a more complex setup process.
